# Hello OAS

## OAS SPEC

https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to HTTP APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types

OpenAPI defines the following basic types:

- [`string`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#string) (this includes dates and [files](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#file))
- [`number`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#numbers)
- [`integer`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#numbers)
- [`boolean`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#boolean)
- [`array`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#array)
- [`object`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#object)

**Swagger** is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs. The major Swagger tools include:

- [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) – browser-based editor where you can write OpenAPI specs.
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) – renders OpenAPI specs as interactive API documentation.
- [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) – generates server stubs and client libraries from an OpenAPI spec.
